new armour to stop propogation of explosive wave front.
the creation of mushroom shaped extrusions to guide wave front onto a guide to redirect wave front up under mushroom lip
this then supports the mushroom head from further damage from the wave front.
this needs further testing in real space to affirm viability, ai confirms the feasability of this new design
